# IT Support Automation Toolkit

This repository contains Python scripts designed to automate common technical support tasks.  
The goal is to improve efficiency, reduce manual work, and standardize troubleshooting routines.

These scripts simulate real-world IT support scenarios and demonstrate practical automation skills.

## 📌 Project Objective

In technical support environments, repetitive tasks such as system checks, backups, and network diagnostics consume time and increase the risk of human error.

This toolkit provides simple automation scripts to:

- Perform system health checks
- Run network diagnostics
- Automate folder backups

All scripts are built using Python standard libraries.
